## Description

This project was a great challenge for myself to push my limits of my knowledge and my skillset involving computers. Not only that, but to learn critical thinking, problem solving, newly evolved skills like developing a growth mind set, becoming familiar with coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and using different software applications I haven't used before. 

This project was created to test all of these new skillsets in developing a simple, yet functional webpage. I ran in to many challenges and problems along the way which i had to overcome, many of them taking many hours and lots of research to forums or youtube videos to resolve them. In the end I feel like I learned a lot about the basics of coding, using sites like github to share repositories, learning commands in terminal, and many more valuable skills.
